# example-package

A simple example of how to structure your project into files and packages.

I have tried to keep the amount of code to a minimum, only keeping the bare essentials to aid in understanding only the practical aspects of the topic at hand.

For more about modules in Python, [see here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/modules.html).

## Terminology
I must admit I'm not really good at this, so if it's wrong send me a pull request.

 - Module - a python sourcefile
 - Package - a collection of modules

## My own experiences with this topic

When I started using Python I had initial troubles with this, now it seems obvious to me. Once you've understood it it will seem pretty simple. I think this is an area where the Python docs do an unusually bad job at introducing the reader to the topic efficiently, but that's just me.
